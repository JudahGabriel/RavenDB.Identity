# <img src="https://github.com/JudahGabriel/RavenDB.Identity/blob/master/RavenDB.Identity/nuget-icon.png?raw=true" width="50px" height="50px" /> RavenDB.Identity
The simple and easy Identity provider for RavenDB and ASP.NET Core. Use Raven to store your users and roles.

## Instructions ##

***Important:** Upgrading from a previous version of RavenDB.Identity? See <a href="#updating-from-old-version">Updating From Old Version</a> for steps to migrate to the latest RavenDB.Identity.*

1. Add an [AppUser class](https://github.com/JudahGabriel/RavenDB.Identity/blob/master/Samples/RazorPages/Models/AppUser.cs) that derives from Raven.Identity.IdentityUser:
```csharp
public class AppUser : Raven.Identity.IdentityUser
{
    /// <summary>
    /// A user's full name.
    /// </summary>
    public string FullName { get; set; }
}
```

2. In appsettings.json, configure your connection to Raven:

```json
"RavenSettings": {
    "Urls": [
        "http://live-test.ravendb.net"
    ],
    "DatabaseName": "Raven.Identity.Sample.RazorPages",
    "CertFilePath": "",
    "CertPassword": ""
},
```

3a. In [Startup.cs](https://github.com/JudahGabriel/RavenDB.Identity/blob/master/Samples/RazorPages/Startup.cs), wire it all up. Note that this approach will use the email address as part of the User Id, such that changing their email will change their User Id as well:

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    // Grab our RavenSettings object from appsettings.json.
    services.Configure<RavenSettings>(Configuration.GetSection("RavenSettings"));
    
    ...
    
    // Add RavenDB and identity.
    services
        .AddRavenDbDocStore() // Create an IDocumentStore singleton from the RavenSettings.
        .AddRavenDbAsyncSession() // Create a RavenDB IAsyncDocumentSession for each request. You're responsible for calling .SaveChanges after each request.
        .AddIdentity<AppUser, IdentityRole>() // Adds an identity system to ASP.NET Core
        .AddRavenDbIdentityStores<AppUser>(); // Use RavenDB as the store for identity users and roles.
    ...
}

public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
{
    ...
    // Instruct ASP.NET Core to use authentication and authorization.
    app.UseAuthentication();
    app.UseAuthorization();
    ...
}
```

4. In your controller actions, [call .SaveChangesAsync() when you're done making changes](https://github.com/JudahGabriel/RavenDB.Identity/blob/master/Samples/RazorPages/Filters/RavenSaveChangesAsyncFilter.cs#L35). Typically this is done via a [RavenController base class](https://github.com/JudahGabriel/RavenDB.Identity/blob/master/Samples/Mvc/Controllers/RavenController.cs) for MVC/WebAPI projects or via a [page filter](https://github.com/JudahGabriel/RavenDB.Identity/blob/master/Samples/RazorPages/Filters/RavenSaveChangesAsyncFilter.cs) for Razor Pages projects.

## Changing how user IDs are generated
By default, user IDs are email based, e.g. `"AppUser/johndoe@mail.com"`. You can change this behavior to instead use server-generated IDs:
```csharp
// Change the user ID generation to use server-generated IDs, e.g. `"AppUser/00001-A"`
services
    .AddRavenDbIdentityStores<AppUser>(o => o.UserIdType = UserIdType.ServerGenerated);
```
Alternately, you can use username-based IDs:
```csharp
// Change the user ID generation to use server-generated IDs, e.g. `"AppUser/00001-A"`
services
    .AddRavenDbIdentityStores<AppUser>(o => o.UserIdType = UserIdType.UserName);
```
Be aware if you have existing users in your database using a different ID generation scheme (e.g. AppUsers/[email]), you'll need to migrate those manually to the new ID type. Failure to do so will result in existing users being unable to log in.

## Modifying RavenDB conventions

Need to modify RavenDB conventions? You can use the `services.AddRavenDbDocStore(options)` overload:

```csharp
services.AddRavenDbDocStore(options =>
{
    // Maybe we want to change the identity parts separator.
    options.BeforeInitializeDocStore = docStore => docStore.Conventions.IdentityPartsSeparator = "-";
})
```

## <a id="updating-from-old-version">Updating From Old Version of RavenDB.Identity</a>

Using an old version of RavenDB.Identity and want to upgrade to the latest? You need to call the `MigrateToV6` method:

```csharp
// Update our existing users to the latest RavenDB.Identity v6.
// This is necessary only if you stored users with a previous version of RavenDB.Identity.
// Failure to call this method will result in existing users not being able to login.
// This method can take several minutes if you have thousands of users.
UserStore<AppUser>.MigrateToV6(docStore);
```

This upgrade step is necessary because we [updated RavenDB.Identity to use RavenDB's cluster-safe compare/exchange](https://github.com/JudahGabriel/RavenDB.Identity/issues/5) to enforce user name/email uniqueness. 

Previous versions of RavenDB.Identity had relied on `IdentityUserByUserName` IDs to enforce uniqueness, but this isn't guaranteed to work in a cluster. Calling MigrateToV6 will create compare/exchange values in Raven for each email address, and will remove the now-obsolete IdentityUserByUserNames collection.
